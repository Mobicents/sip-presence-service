implementation, now adding RCS to supported standard networks.

What is new?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Performance & Stability:
+-- Latest SLEE 2.4.1.FINAL;
+-- Optimized SLEE app code, taking full advantage of custom Mobicents 
JAIN SLEE 1.1 Extensions.
+-- Several issues fixed, some not even listed on Issue Tracker;
+-- Network Simulation tools ensures stable memory and performance
behavior on long runs.

2) XDM Server:

for XML Patch Ops included;
+-- IETF Presence Document Content Manipulation (RFC 4827) XCAP App 
Usage, for storage of permanent presence state;
+-- OMA XDM 2.0 Presence Content XCAP App Usage, for storage of content 
such as status icons;
+-- Optimized XCAP App Usage management, pooling of instances not 
needed anymore;
+-- XCAP Diff Super Users support, these will have authorization to subscribe 
changes in any document or collection.

3) Presence and Resource Lists Servers:
+-- Pres Rules Transformations, documents are now used not only to authorize 
presence subscriptions, but to transform the presence state notified. Polite 
blocking supported too;
+-- Service that monitors permanent presence state in the XDMS, such state is 
then composed with the state published through SIP;
+-- Extended Accepted Presence Content:
    - OMA Extensions to PIDF and Presence Data Model, OMA PDE 1.0, OMA 
PDE 1.1
    - IETF RFCs 3863, 4479, 4480, 4481, 4482, 4199, 5196;
+-- Simpler extension of accepted presence content, just drop xsd files in 
related configuration directory and the server will automatically combine all 
to achieve the supported documents schema;
+-- JAXB replaced with DOM in publication and subscription interfaces, faster 
and better validation of state published, no unneeded XML namespaces in the 
notified state;
+-- Multiple event packages now supported in the SIP Event Publication 
Control, opens the door for the support of other publishing services in the 
integrated server.
