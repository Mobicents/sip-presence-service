/**
 * This XCAP Authorization Policy implements the Default
 * Authorization Policy.
 * 
 * By XCAP Specs:
 * 
 * "This application usage does not modify the default XCAP authorization
 * policy, which is that only a user can read, write or modify their own
 * documents.  A server can allow privileged users to modify documents
 * that they don't own, but the establishment and indication of such
 * policies is outside the scope of this document.  It is anticipated
 * that a future application usage will define which users are allowed
 * to modify an RLS services document.
 * 
 * The index document maintained in the global tree represents sensitive
 * information, as it contains the union of all of the information for
 * all users on the server.  As such, its access MUST be restricted to
 * trusted elements within domain of the server.  Typically, this would
 * be limited to the RLSs that need access to this document."
 *
